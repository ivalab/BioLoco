**Abstract** Deriving equations of motion for snake movement on a flat
plane is fairly easy and provides a unified approach to modeling many
different gats.

Motion in the plane for the snake is actually quite accomodating from the
mathematical perspective.  All of the gaits that we can perform with the
snake on flat ground can be analyzed using a little geometry and some
differential equations.  Normally reserchers choose to model the snake
from the joint angles of the actuators (need pic).
