**Abstract** When the correct representation for modeling snake movement
is chosen, then deriving equations of motion for snake movement on a flat
plane is fairly easy.  Furthermore, one overall dynamic model provides a
unified approach to modeling many different gaits.  So far, we have
modeled rectilinear locomotion, lateral undulation, and sidewinding.
A turn-in-place gait is currently under study.

Motion in the plane for the snake is actually quite accomodating from the
mathematical perspective.  All of the gaits that we can perform with the
snake on flat ground can be analyzed using a little geometry and some
differential equations.  Normally reserchers choose to model the snake
from the joint angles of the actuators (need pic).
