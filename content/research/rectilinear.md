**Abstract:** Rectilinear locomotion is different from but analgous to
caterpillar locomotion. The body undulates vertically only to move
forward. Curving the body leads to turning.

The easiest gait to analyze, produce, and control is the rectilinear
locomotion gait. It is not because the other gaits are necessarily
harder to work out, but because rectilinear locomotion is so slow!
That permits use the ability to use our overhead tracking system for
performing closed-loop control without worrying about the snake going
out of bounds.  A few gaits of sidewinding and the snake isn't in the
field of view anymore.
