So far we have one truly functional robot, Snakey.  Every once in a
while Snakey will sport a head consisting of a wireless monocular or stereo
camera.

We have a once functional robot, Sally the Supermander, who apparently
was used to scavenge motors from.  We are in the process of bringing her
back to her original glory.

And we have a small quadruped that needs lots of love to get functional
again, Kitty the Robocat (aka Crookshanks).

Off-and-on we are working towards creating a small Gorilla-bot and
some other fun biologically-inspired robots that could be used to
showcase the mathematics and algorithms we've derived.
