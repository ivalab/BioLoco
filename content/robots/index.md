So far we have one truly functional robot, Snakey.  The rest are
undergoing rebuilds.
You can learn about what we are doing with each robot by following the
tag link with their name on the left. No tag means nothing is ready yet.

#### Snakey 
This robotic snake sports custom scales on the bottom side (can be seen
in the photos), whose role is to help snakey locomote.  They work well
except when on smooth surfaces.  Unfortunately, snake locomotion is
horrible on smooth surfaces since it relies on friction.  We are
working to give snakey a _foot_ on the last link so he can push himself
along like a caterpiller. Sort of like in this [youtube
video](https://youtu.be/bG-cIqZ8aS0?list=PLWPjf-IY-3dFPOgOVGT0ZLxKkk4hh0dXV&t=26),
where the rear-most foot is making all of the action happen.
Every once in a while Snakey will sport a head consisting of a wireless
monocular or stereo camera for testing out our
[SLAM](https://ivalab.github.io/RoboSLAM/public/) and 
[Visual Navigation](https://ivalab.github.io/VisNav/public/) algorithms.

#### Sally 
We have a once functional robot, Sally the Supermander, who apparently
was used to scavenge motors from.  We are in the process of bringing her
back to her original glory.

#### Kitty 
And we have a small quadruped that needs lots of love to get functional
again, Kitty the Robocat (aka Crookshanks).

Off-and-on we are working towards creating a small Gorilla-bot and
some other fun biologically-inspired robots that could be used to
showcase the mathematics and algorithms we've derived.
