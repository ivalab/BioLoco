So far, we have been studying snake locomotion with the intent to figure
out how to perform planning, trajectory synthesis, and feedback control
for this class of bio-inspired robots.  We got the theory mostly worked
out for flat planar surface, and hope that we can experimentally verify
the mathematics.  So far, we've got rectilinear motion down, and are going
to take care of sidewinding next.  Lateral undulation is a bit trickier
since the motion dynamics are a bit more complex.
